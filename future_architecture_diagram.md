 Explanation & Improvements

1.  Frontend: React dashboard and mobile app for real-time analytics and chat.
2. API Gateway: Centralized routing, load balancing, and security.
3. Microservices: Modular FastAPI services and dedicated Auth service.
4. LLM Orchestration: LangChain manages multiple LLMs and tools.
5. Databases: Cloud MongoDB Atlas, MySQL, and a data lake for unstructured data.
6. Caching: Redis for fast queries and session management.
7. Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana, ELK, and Sentry for observability.
8. DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD for scalable, resilient deployments.
9. Security: Zero Trust, encryption, and compliance-ready architecture.

This design is ready for enterprise-scale, secure, and high-performance celebrity wealth management.
